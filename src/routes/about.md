## History

#### 2021

- Look at learning Svelte.js and SvelteKit. This site is actually built using those tools.
- Back to School
- Worked with Express as opposed to Hapi.js for Node.js development

#### 2020

- Learn enough [Golang](https://golang.org/) to be dangerous
- Look into TypeScript, LitHtml, Express, GraphQL
- Microservices with Node
- Learn [Svelte.js](https://svelte.dev/) as a client-side framework

#### 2019

Themes are Code-Quality (Testing, Documentation), REST alternatives and Client-Side frameworks. As big part of testing in JS is type-checking, using TypeScript could be considered a part of testing.

- Start using JDoc or alternative on all code.
- [Try Express to compare with Hapi](https://www.udemy.com/all-about-nodejs/)
- Is [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) a good alternative to REST?
- Get basic knowledge on [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) as an alternative language
- Look into new ECMA features for Node. Check [node green](https://node.green/).

#### 2018

- Use [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) for code linting and formatting
- New ECMA features. Check [node green](https://node.green/) for things you can use in node
- Switch node servers to use hapi 17, Node 8+ , async/await
- Using Node 8+ objects and arrays has .includes() function
